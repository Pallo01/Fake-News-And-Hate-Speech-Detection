      <h1>What is Fake News?</h1>
      <p className="description">Fake news is false or misleading information presented as if it were true, often with the intention of deceiving people. It can take many forms, including fabricated stories, manipulated images or videos, and biased or misleading reporting. Fake news can be spread through traditional news media, social media platforms, and other online channels.<br></br>

Fake news is dangerous because it can have serious consequences for individuals and society as a whole. When people believe false information, they may make decisions based on that information that can be harmful to themselves or others. For example, someone might refuse to get vaccinated against a disease because they have read false information about the vaccine, putting themselves and others at risk of infection.<br></br>

Fake news can also undermine trust in institutions, including the news media and government, and erode social cohesion. It can be used as a tool for propaganda and disinformation, particularly by authoritarian regimes or those seeking to sow division or confusion in democratic societies.<br></br>

In addition, fake news can be used to manipulate public opinion or influence elections, as we have seen in recent years with the rise of so-called "fake news" campaigns. This can have serious implications for the democratic process and the legitimacy of political institutions.<br></br>

Overall, the spread of fake news is a serious problem that requires careful attention and action by individuals, governments, and technology companies to prevent its harmful effects.</p>

      <p className="subheading">Additionally, machine learning can be used to detect fake news by analyzing patterns and trends in the information. Natural Language Processing techniques can be used to analyze the language and tone of the content to determine if it is likely to be fake.</p>
